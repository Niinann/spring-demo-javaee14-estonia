### Useful git commands
- git status - show what happens inside repository - current status
- git log - show history of repository

### Git rules
- working directory should be clean when we travel between commits and branches
- every time: new task = new branch
- git status shows what is going on in local repository, and git fetch shows what is going on on remote repositories
